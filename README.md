# Introduction
One day I woke up. I was totally in a panic because I have to release a new version of my restaurant manager app to solve a problem of a restaurant near my home. 

Unfortunately, I do not had such an app. So I create this one to sleep better in the future.

Editing this README does not cause a pipeline to run. This helps to save the clima.
