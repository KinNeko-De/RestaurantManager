# Introduction
Waking up one day. I was totally in a panic because I had to release a new version of my restaurant manager app to solve a problem of a restaurant near my home. 

Unfortunately, this app doesn't exist yet. So I create this solution to sleep better in the future.

Editing this README does not cause a pipeline to run. This helps to save the clima.
